Hi there ,
I am currently exploring Machine learning field .
Previously , I explored Front-end Development and did courses offered by University of Michigan and Meta .
I also explored Information Retrieval field which was quite interesting .
I have also worked on freelancing projects and been Teaching Assitant in my University for programming course .
Currently I am looking for opportunities through which I can implement my existing skills , gain new and make an impact in workplace .
